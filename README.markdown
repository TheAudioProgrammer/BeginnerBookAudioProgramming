# The Complete Beginner's Guide to Audio Plug-in Development

This is the source code that accompanies the book [The Complete Beginner's Guide to Audio Plug-in Development](https://theaudioprogrammer.com/audio-plugin-guide) by Matthijs Hollemans, available for purchase from [The Audio Programmer](https://theaudioprogrammer.com/audio-plugin-guide) as PDF and EPUB.

In this 470-page book you'll learn how to make an audio plug-in, also known as a VST — even if you have never written a line of computer code in your life.

This is a tutorial-style book that goes step-by-step and explains everything you need to know along the way. It is written for complete beginners. No prior programming knowledge is required and there is not a lot of math involved.

The goal of this book is to make audio programming accessible to everyone — without requiring a computer science degree, audio engineering degree, or any other qualifications. All you need is a functioning brain, an eagerness to learn, and a little patience. The book does the rest by giving detailed explanations for everything, including as many screenshots and illustrations as possible.

The plug-in that you'll learn to make is a **ping-pong delay** that can be used in all the popular DAWs such as Logic Pro, Ableton Live, REAPER, FL Studio, Cubase, Bitwig Studio, and others.

The plug-in is made using industry standard tools for audio programming: the JUCE framework and the C++ programming language. You'll learn all the fundamentals of writing audio plug-ins, in an easy-to-follow guide that is light on math and heavy on being practical.

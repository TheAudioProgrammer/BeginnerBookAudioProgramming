# Errata

This is a list of known mistakes and bugs in the book *The Complete Beginner's Guide to Audio Plug-in Development* and/or the accompanying source code.

## EPUB issues

Chapters 8 and 11 of the EPUB version of the book may show an error message in Apple Books and other e-readers. The text of these chapters is incomplete due to this error.

On certain e-readers (such as the Kindle app), reading in dark mode used low-contrast colors.

These issues have been fixed and an updated EPUB file is available. Please go to [your Lemon Squeezy order page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/my-orders) to download the latest version of the EPUB file. (The PDF version does not have these errors.)

## Chapter 6: AUAudioFilePlayer not listed in AudioPluginHost

The section *Playing audio files (Mac)* says, "Right-click inside the AudioPluginHost window again and from the pop-up choose Apple > AUAudioFilePlayer." It's possible AUAudioFilePlayer is not listed as a plug-in that you can choose.

To fix this, in AudioPluginHost go to the **Options** menu in the menu bar and select **Edit the List of Available Plug-Ins**. In the window that appears, click on **Options...** at the bottom and choose **Scan for new or updated AudioUnit plug-ins**. After a short while, AUAudioFilePlayer should appear in the list.

Additionally, you can follow the instructions from the next section, *Playing audio files (Windows)*, and use the AudioFilePlayer project to play sounds.

## Chapter 8, page 170: Missing line of code

In the section *Improving the class*, at the top of page 170 in the PDF and print versions of the book, the reader is asked to change the code in **Parameters.h**. In the provided source code the following line has gone missing:

```c++
const juce::ParameterID gainParamID { "gain", 1 };
```

This line was first added on page 167 and it reappears on page 174. You're not supposed to delete this line. It is a mistake that this line is not included in the code on page 170.

## Chapter 18, page 413

Item 4 in the numbered list says:

> If `targetDelay` is the same as `delaySamples`, the **Delay Time** parameter did not change since last time and nothing needs to happen.

The variable name should be `delayInSamples`, not `delaySamples`. (It is correct in the actual source code and elsewhere in the book.)

## Xcode error: A build only device cannot be used to run this target

You may get the following error message from Xcode:

![](Images/BuildOnlyDeviceError.png)

This happens when the run destination at the top of the Xcode window is set to **Any Mac**. When Any Mac is selected, Xcode only lets you build the project but not run it. To fix this, click on Any Mac and change this setting to **My Mac**.

## Xcode error: Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code

Xcode may give the error "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" with an additional message saying, "resource fork, Finder information, or similar detritus not allowed".

This happens when the project folder is placed in the iCloud directory. Apparently the iCloud folder has extra files in it that break the building process.

Try moving the folder to the Desktop. Then delete the **Builds** folder and export again from Projucer. Now it should build without issues.
